# Credit_Risk_Analysis
ML, python

### Overview of the loan prediction risk analysis:

The purpose of this analysis is well defined (4 pt)


### Results:

There is a bulleted list that describes the balanced accuracy score and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models. Use screenshots of your outputs to support your results.(15 pt)

#### Deliverable 1: Use Resampling Models to Predict Credit Risk

An accuracy score for the model is calculated (7.5 pt)
A confusion matrix has been generated (7.5 pt)
An imbalanced classification report has been generated

#### Deliverable 2: Use the SMOTEENN algorithm to Predict Credit Risk

An accuracy score for the model is calculated (5 pt)
A confusion matrix has been generated (5 pt)
An imbalanced classification report has been generated 

#### Deliverable 3: Use Ensemble Classifiers to Predict Credit Risk

The BalancedRandomForestClassifier algorithm does the following:
An accuracy score for the model is calculated (2.5 pt)
A confusion matrix has been generated (2.5 pt)
An imbalanced classification report has been generated (5 pt)
The features are sorted in descending order by feature importance (5 pt)

The EasyEnsembleClassifier algorithm does the following:
An accuracy score of the model is calculated (2.5 pt)
A confusion matrix has been generated (2.5 pt)
An imbalanced classification report has been generated 





### Summary:

There is a summary of the results (2 pt)
There is a recommendation on which model to use, or there is no recommendation with a justification If you do not recommend any of the models, justify your reasoning.
